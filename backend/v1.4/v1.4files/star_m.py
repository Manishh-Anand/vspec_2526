star_output = """S (Situation):  
The user currently relies on manually initiating project meetings without automation. They want an agentic system integrated with Siri to automate these processes, creating meetings via Google Meet and sending meeting links through a WhatsApp group named "Final year project."

T (Task):  
Automate the creation of meetings in Google Meet upon receiving Siri commands ("start project meeting") and send the meeting link to the specified WhatsApp group.

A (Action):  
1. Develop an app action for Google Meet to create instant meetings when triggered by a Siri command, ensuring real-time visibility.  
2. Integrate an app action for WhatsApp to send meeting links through a configured notification channel specifically for the "Final year project" group.  
3. Program Siri to trigger both app actions upon receiving the "start project meeting" command, ensuring seamless integration and execution without user intervention.

R (Result):  
Upon successful implementation, the user will seamlessly initiate meetings via Siri, receive real-time updates through Google Meet, and have meeting links delivered promptly within the WhatsApp group, eliminating manual processes."""
