Then create a new page in my workspace and write a short point-wise summary of what you found about this bike. After that, add a calendar event for taking a test ride of this bike on 20th November at 3:30 pm. Next, draft an email to my friend at 1dt22ca027@dsatm.edu.in
 saying that I am interested in this bike and asking if they will accompany me for the test ride. Finally, create a new repository in my github account and add a README.md file that contains the same summarized points about the bike." """
