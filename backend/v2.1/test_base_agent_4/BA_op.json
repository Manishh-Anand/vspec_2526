    "user_prompt": "Hey so read my last email from 1dt22ca027@dsatm.edu.in and analyze what the email is about and provide me the best solution to solve this problem. After finding the solution You need to mail the solution to manishmaverick10@gmail.com and also create a notion page of the solution and create a GitHub page for this solution.",
    "star_formatted": "Sure, I can help you format that prompt into the STAR method. Here's how it would look:\n\n**S (Situation):**\nYou received an email from \"1dt22ca027@dsatm.edu.in\" and need to analyze its content to understand the problem presented.\n\n**T (Task):**\nThe task involves analyzing the email, identifying the specific issue or problem mentioned, devising a solution to address that problem, and then taking two additional actions: sending the solution via email to \"manishmaverick10@gmail.com\" and creating both a Notion page and a GitHub repository for documentation of the solution.\n\n**A (Action):**\n1. **Read and Analyze:** Carefully read the email from \"1dt22ca027@dsatm.edu.in\" to understand the problem or issue being raised.\n2. **Solution Development:** Based on the analysis, develop a comprehensive solution that effectively addresses the problem identified in the email.\n3. **Email Solution:** Compose an email detailing the solution and send it to \"manishmaverick10@gmail.com.\"\n4. **Create Notion Page:** Set up a Notion page to document the solution, including details such as problem description, proposed solution steps, and any relevant information or resources.\n5. **Set Up GitHub Repository:** Initialize a GitHub repository for version control and documentation of the solution. Include files like code snippets (if applicable), diagrams, and detailed explanation documents.\n\n**R (Result):**\n- Successfully analyzed the email to identify the problem.\n- Developed and proposed an effective solution addressing the identified issue.\n- Sent the solution via email to \"manishmaverick10@gmail.com.\"\n- Created a Notion page with comprehensive documentation of the solution.\n- Set up a GitHub repository for ongoing collaboration, version control, and easy access to all related files and information.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that you systematically address each part of the task, providing clear steps from situation analysis through to final execution.",
